Recently I had a post on my TikTok go viral that so far gained 4M views and 580K+ likes and 11K shares.
Aside from my post, it has been reposted by other people [on Twitter with 77K likes](https://twitter.com/ShitpostGate/status/1592369346667761668?t=1eclUYzGcuPDBXQEW19xAA&s=19), and [on r/pcmasterrace with 2M views and 41K upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/yr7fz9/most_sane_tiktok_cybersecurity_expert/).

### First Hate comment

I want to commemorate my first hate comment of all time.

For the rest of my life I will wonder what infuriated this person so much.

### Barstool Sports

Around the time my TikTok had 2M views (about 1.5 days after I posted it), Barstool Sports reached out to me asking for permission to post my content on their accounts.

In order to submit a video, you must fill out [this form](https://www.barstoolsports.com/videosubmission). By filling out that form, you agree to their "Exclusive Content License & Submission Policy" which is not really a policy but more of an exclusive contract to my video.

    Me: "How do I get compensated?"
    Them: "We don’t pay. Once you submit you can still let other accounts post"
    Me: "? But the contract says I give you “the exclusive right to (1) post Your Content on our Platform, …, (3) license Your Content to third parties for their use in exchange for payment,”"
    Me: "My understanding is that I can't let other accounts post"
    Them: "You can"
    Them: "We just say that to protect us from other companies that will try to copyright us if you don’t submit"
    Me: "If I don’t submit? If I don’t agree to the contract then I don’t see how the wording of the contract could possible protect you. Even if it did, if I never signed the copyright to you then how could you possibly protect yourself from copyright infringement if I or some other company has ownership."
    Them: "Have a good day"

I have never felt so disrespected in my life. Even though I cited specific points in their agreement, they tried lying in order to fool me into signing an unfair contract twice. Barstool Sports is worth $450 million yet they feel the need to be dishonest in order to get more content for their repost farm. Whoever I was dealing with was extremely confident that it would work because it probably did work on the thousands of people who unwittingly signed away their rights to their own videos without reading the fine text of the agreement.  

They're not the only content farm that reached out to me. There was another company who posts "meme compilations" who verbally promised me 30% of the revenue from videos. Each meme compilation probably had hundreds of memes so there is no chance I would get an entire 30%. Their contract gave them the rights to my video, but did not mention anything about giving me any cut of the revenue.

The most egregious thing about these contracts is when you give away your content essentially for free, these businesses do not have to give anything back in return. They are not obligated to actually use your content. They can simply choose not to use it while still retaining rights over it. I strongly believe that this is by design. They cast a wide net, coaxing anyone they can to sign their exclusive pacts. Then, they have the luxury to pick and choose what they want to post while depriving other businesses of their leftovers.

### Conclusion

This had absolutely no bearing on my life. My friends didn't really care besides them @ing me when they saw my video reposted on other sites. I did not gain anything from this experience.
